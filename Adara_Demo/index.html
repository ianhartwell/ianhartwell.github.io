                    <h2>Mission</h2>
                    <p>Adara exists as a sustainable foundation for decentralized governance on Cardano, one that not only serves the present but actively nurtures the next generation of contributors. We believe governance should be enabling, inclusive, and regenerative.
                    <br><br>
                    Our mission is to support participation in governance at all levels, from onboarding and education to leadership and stewardship. Adara aims to create accessible and welcoming pathways for community members to join, learn, grow, and step into roles within governance structures like the Constitutional Committee. By combining our members' deep expertise and experience with an ethos of support, inclusivity and enablement, we hope to build a resilient governance culture that sustains itself through renewal.
                    <br><br>
                    We are committed to:
                    Providing opportunities for people to develop governance skills and experience related to the Cardano Constitution.
                    Supporting training, onboarding, and knowledge-sharing so others can develop their own governance capabilities.
                    Creating continuity within the Constitutional Committee by mentoring and preparing new contributors.
                    Serving the Cardano community with integrity, care, and professionalism, working alongside and collaboratively with all members of the CC.

                    <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>Adara brings together a group of four individuals with complementary experience across governance, education, technical implementation, and organizational leadership within the Cardano ecosystem. Collectively, our members have served on the Interim Constitutional Committee (ICC), held DRep and SPO roles, contributed to CIP-1694, and led or supported dozens of community governance workshops. Our experience spans the practical, procedural, and people-oriented aspects of decentralized governance.
                        <br><br>
                        As a consortium, we are united by a shared belief that good governance requires more than expertise, it demands continuity, inclusion, and the active nurturing of future contributors. We are committed to shaping a resilient Constitutional Committee that governs transparently today, while also investing time in onboarding, mentorship, and the development of others for tomorrow.</p>
                        <h4>Governance Leadership & Experience</h4>
                        <p>Members of Adara have served on the Interim Constitutional Committee, the Intersect Constitutional Council (including Chair and Secretary roles), and the Civics Committee.
                        We have authored and submitted rationale for constitutional governance actions, facilitated and participated in constitutional workshops globally (e.g. Edinburgh, Costa Rica), and played roles in the community’s preparation for the 2024 Constitutional Convention in Buenos Aires.<br>
                        As registered DReps and long-time ADA holders, our members have consistently voted on-chain and helped educate others on how to engage meaningfully in governance.<br>
                        We have also supported the growth and operation of SanchoNet as a testing ground for governance evolution, and continue to contribute through working groups, education, and tooling feedback.</p>
                        <h4>Technical and Operational Depth</h4>
                        <p>Our technical backgrounds include experience in software architecture, governance systems engineering, and enterprise data solutions.<br>
                        Our SPO and DRep members have implemented multisig CLI workflows, supported early governance testnet upgrades, and maintained active infrastructure.<br>
                        Our members bring operational delivery and strategic planning experience from public and private sectors, including process development, system design, stakeholder engagement, and cross-regional governance implementation.</p>
                        <h4>Community Education & Enabling</h4>
                        <p>Adara is deeply committed to onboarding, training, and knowledge-sharing. Our members have hosted regular workshops, written educational resources, simplified key governance processes for broad accessibility, and provided support to new participants entering the governance space.<br>
                        We have worked with underrepresented communities and across languages and regions to make governance more approachable and culturally inclusive.<br>
                        Our members use tools like behavioral science frameworks to shape participation strategies that meet people where they are, making governance not just understandable but actionable.</p>
                        <h4>Long-Term Vision</h4>
                        <p>We are building for sustainability. A key pillar of Adara’s approach is to design systems and processes that outlast our own participation. We believe the Constitutional Committee should not only provide oversight, but also cultivate pathways for others to grow into these responsibilities over time.</p>
